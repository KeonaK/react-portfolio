        <h3>Ambience Market Watch and Currency Exchange</h3>
        <p>
          This is a group project that is an application that combines different
          types of market data to allow users to make educated decisions on
          their future investments to their portfolios. With an ever-changing
          world where the dollar is becoming less used for international
          trading; we have also designed into the feature a currency exchange
          list for the most traded world currencies. Also, for the userâ€™s
          convenience our team has introduced a currency exchange calculator to
          make conversions even easier. At the bottom of the application we have
          also included different commodities exchange pricing so that the user
          has a one stop shop to differing market portfolio options.
