          <h3>Ambience Market Watch and Currency Exchange</h3>
          <p>
            This is a group project that is an application that combines
            different types of market data to allow users to make educated
            decisions on their future investments to their portfolios. With an
            ever-changing world where the dollar is becoming less used for
            international trading; we have also designed into the feature a
            currency exchange list for the most traded world currencies. Also,
            for the userâ€™s convenience our team has introduced a currency
            exchange calculator to make conversions even easier. At the bottom
            of the application we have also included different commodities
            exchange pricing so that the user has a one stop shop to differing
            market portfolio options.
