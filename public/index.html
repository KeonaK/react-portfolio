      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            <h3>Ambience Market Watch and Currency Exchange</h3>
            <p>This is a group project that is an application that combines different types of market data to allow users to make educated decisions on their future investments to their portfolios. With an ever-changing world where the dollar is becoming less used for international trading; we have also designed into the feature a currency exchange list for the most traded world currencies. Also, for the userâ€™s convenience our team has introduced a currency exchange calculator to make conversions even easier. At the bottom of the application we have also included different commodities exchange pricing so that the user has a one stop shop to differing market portfolio options.</p>
